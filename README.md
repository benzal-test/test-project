# Hello World - GitOps

This projects runs a minimal (Build & Deploy) GitOps-style pipeline. The deployment updates the manifests in [another manifest project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-examples/ops/gitops-demo/k8s-agents).

This project is intended to be minimal to showcase the required setup using the GitLab Agent for Kubernetes for pull-based deployments.
